# CodeX Beverage Price Prediction

A Streamlit-based application that predicts beverage price ranges based on user inputs such as age group, income level, health concerns, purchasing habits, and more.

## Features
- Predicts a beverage's price range using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Flexible input options capturing various demographic and behavioral features.
